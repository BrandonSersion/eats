    <h1>"Changes"</h1>
    
    <p>
      I still don't know what I was waiting for
      And my time was running wild
      A million dead-end streets
      And every time I thought I'd got it made
      It seemed the taste was not so sweet
      So I turned myself to face me
      But I've never caught a glimpse
      Of how the others must see the faker
      I'm much too fast to take that test
    </p>
    <p>
      Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
      (Turn and face the strange)
      Ch-ch-changes
      Don't want to be a richer man
      Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
      (Turn and face the strange)
      Ch-ch-changes
      Just gonna have to be a different man
      Time may change me
      But I can't trace time
    </p>
